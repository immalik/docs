Git is a version control system that helps you manage changes to a code repository; 

GitHub is a site that provides Git hosting, plus project management and collaboration features.

If you try to learn both at once it will be harder. You won't always know what's "just Git" and what is a GitHub feature.

Git will run fine locally on your computer, you don't even need a network connection to play with it.

Get some basic Git skills, then start poking around GitHub (maybe ask your profs for some good projects to look at).
